# YouTube File Store
A small project testing the feasibility of using YouTube to store files.

## Goals
The goal of this program is to test whether or not YouTube can be used as a method for distributing files. Upon completion the program should be able to:
* Encode a file as a video and upload to YouTube
* Download a video from YouTube and decode it

## Note
Please use this program at your own risk. I am unsure if doing this will violate YouTube's ToS.
